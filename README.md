# FEM Credit Card Project - Using position absolute in a responsive layout
This is the finished code from [this YouTube tutorial](https://github.com/kevin-powell/fem-credit-card-form) where I look at using `position: absolute` within a responsive layout, and break down my thinking and process on ensuring that everything stays responsive.

## The project
In this video I used [this project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw) from [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
